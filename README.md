# Horiseon Landing Page CSS and HTML Code Refactor

## Description

Project background: The HTML and CSS files for the original landing page is functional, but it’s not concise. The CSS contains multiple classes that share the same styling but are all listed separately, and the HTML uses divs for everything instead of specifying a semantic element. Images also do not continue any alt text.

Solution: Cleaning up the code made it easier to work with in the future, and using semantic elements improved SEO and accessibility for customers that use screen readers. Adding alt text also allows customers using screen readers understand the significance of the images on the page.

Learns: There were a handful of semantic elements that I wasn’t aware of before, and was able to apply them to this code.
